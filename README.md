## Guild Overview

We're a community of like-minded players who strive for end-game content and gear without dedicating our entire lives to it. Even though gearing up is important to us, the social aspects of our community will always be the priority. After all, what's the point if we're not having fun?

We're generally on the older side of the spectrum, 20-30+ year-olds, including some OG's from Maplestory 1. We recruit members of all ages however, it's more a question of maturity than age.

### Guidelines

- Be respectful (to everyone, not just fellow members)
- Be helpful
- No spamming, begging, pleading, etc.
- No harassment
- Min level and gear score requirement will eventually be implemented

### Recruitment

Preferably with two or three other guild members, hop on your Duck mount, and quack (hold <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>) at the potential recruit. If the recruit responds by quacking on their Duck, they're in!

The above is subject to change, but it is our current method of initiation :)

### General Info

- Discord channel link is posted in the Guild Tab > Guild Notice in-game.
- Official Guild Channel: 7
- Official Server: NA West
- If you don't have a Premium Package with unlimited Rotors, you can find portals to all major destinations in the houses of the following members:
  - G6/Tattoos

### UGC

Some of us are also big into UGC (User-generated Content). We make our own in-game clothes and gear. Ask in Discord for Photoshop/design help.

Also, we'll be designing a Guild-specific outfit, stay tuned!

## Beginner Tips

Tips below are not exhaustive, just what worked for me so far

- Skill Tree reset is free and unlimited, so experiment with your skills!
- Attribute Points reset is also free and unlimited
- You don't have to buy an air mount with merets, you can get some for free via Maple Guide
- There's a 50,000 mesos Festival Balloons air mount that you can buy from Supply Vendors (NPC) in major cities (Tria, Henesys, Ellinia, etc.) to move horizontally faster
- General goals:
  1. reach lvl 50 or 60
  2. Gear score: 1500 (normal dungeons)
  3. Gear score: 2100 (hard dungeons)
  4. Gear score: 3300 (chaos raids)

## How-to reach level 50

Even though level 60 is max level, 50-60 doesn't provide additional benefits (actually a detriment, more below), so getting to 50 should be the focus.

- Follow [Epic] quest line till the end
- This gets your Gear Score to 1500, minimum requirement for Normal Dungeons
- Run Normal Dungeons to get purple (epic) gear, or until you save enough mesos to buy your first purple from the Black Market
- Once you have 2100 gear score, run Hard Dungeons

## How-to reach level 60

Being level 60 currently will reduce your damage output due to Nexon's Fair Fight mechanics. It's basically damage scaling, so a level 60 with the same gear as a level 50 will do less damage in a level 50 dungeon.

Since there are no level 50+ dungeons, the higher the level, the more severe the damage scaling.

- Complete [Epic] quest line (minor XP)
- Kill World Bosses (extra XP if in party)
- Auto play music or auto fish (easiest)

## How-to obtain 1500 Gear Score

- The [Epic] quest line will give you two +7 enchant scrolls (only usable on lv 49 or below gear)
- Use one of the +7 on the last blue weapon the [Epic] quest gives you (should be a lv 48 weapon)
- Use your second +7 enchant scroll on your next best piece of armor (preferably blue, should be lv 48-49 gear)

## Alternative to 1500 Gear Score

- If for whatever reason you cannot do the above, you can also buy all the lv 50 blue gear for your class in Black Market to reach 1500 (each blue piece is cheap, ~20k-40k mesos each)

## Getting to 2100 Gear Score

- It is usually not recommended to buy your purple weapon from the Black Market, because within 4 Hard Dungeon runs, you'll get a purple weapon guaranteed
- There are multiple ways however
  - Getting 1 purple gear and enchanting the rest of your gear until 2100
  - Getting the purple suit of your choice (should be biggest boost to gear score)

## Normal Dungeon Tips/Info

- Purple drop rate is terrible
- Most (if not all) of the gear obtained in Normal Dungeons can be traded/sold
- Spend as little time as possible running Normal Dungeons (once you can afford to gear up to 2100, do so)

## Hard Dungeon Tips/Info

- Guaranteed purple drops per run -- if gear is not for your class, dismantle for fragment
- Guaranteed purple for your class within 4 runs due to fragments (including weapon)
- Most of the gear obtained in Hard Dungeons cannot be traded or sold
- Learn the boss mechanics via YouTube, or possibly even running it solo a couple times (without using pots/resources) to get a feel for things, or we can set up some learning sessions

## Post Level Cap

- Complete Daily Missions
- Complete 10 dungeon runs
- Farm special currencies for different merchants

## Misc Tips

- Once your character gets to 2100 gear score, they mostly gear themselves
- Below 2100, alts are helpful to increase daily/weekly dungeon run limits
- Create alts to pool resources
- Every new alt to max level generates ~3M mesos
- Sell onyx crystals if needed to reach 2100 gear score

## Dungeon-specific Tips

### Tronix Bunker

- Skip the early mobs and run straight to mini-bosses
- Use the EMP Bombs/Canisters on the map to stun the bosses (cuts completion time down significantly)
- You can bait the bosses into destroying fences to give access to EMPs
- Don't take damage while carrying an EMP, it will disappear!

### The Fire Dragon

- Treat your burns!
- Berserkers can hit Fire Dragon with the Spin Attack while in one of the holes
